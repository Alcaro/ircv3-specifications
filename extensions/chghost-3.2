The chghost client capability allows a client to directly capture a host change
without having to do a fake quit and join. This capability MUST be referred to
as 'chghost' at capability negotiation time.

When enabled, clients will get the CHGHOST message to designate the host of a
user changing for clients on common channels with them.

The CHGHOST message is one of the following:

    :nick!user@host CHGHOST new.host.goes.here

This message represents that the user identified by nick!user@host has changed
host to another value. The last parameter is the new host the user is using.

In order to take full advantage of the CHGHOST message, clients must be modified
to support it. The proper way to do so is this:

1) Enable the chghost capability at capability negotiation time during the
   login handshake.

2) When receiving a CHGHOST message, update the host part of the data structure
   to change the host to the new value
