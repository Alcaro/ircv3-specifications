## The `batch` client capability

This extension describes a capability which causes a new verb to be sent to
clients when the IRC server wishes to designate that a series of events are
related to each other.

Use-cases include visual suppression of netsplits and netjoins. 

The name of this client capability MUST be named `batch`.

## The `BATCH` verb

The IRC server will send a `BATCH` verb when it wants the client to begin
batching events together, and send another `BATCH` verb when the transaction
is concluded.

The following syntax MUST be used when starting a batch:

	BATCH [optional reference tag]

The following syntax MUST be used when ending a batch:

	BATCH -[optional reference tag]

If there is no reference tag, then the reference tag should be left blank.

## Example

Here is an example of the BATCH verb being used:

	BATCH yXNAbvnRHTRBv
	:nenolod!nenolod@localhost QUIT :*.net *.split
	:jilles!jilles@localhost QUIT :*.net *.split
	BATCH -yXNAbvnRHTRBv

The client could then realize that both nenolod and jilles quit due to a
netsplit without having to guess.
